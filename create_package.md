A software component in SAP is a unit of software that is delivered to customers as a set of packages. Software components are released in stages, with each new release adding new features. 

- A software component is made up of packages that contain development objects. 
- Developers assign development objects to packages, which implicitly assigns the objects to a software component. 
- Each software component has multiple releases, with each release adding new features. 
- Patches can be imported into a software component separately. 

### Steps :
